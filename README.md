RepRapBCN Printing Configurations
---------------------------------
![Towers help us improving the configurations!](http://reprapbcn.github.io/images/torres.jpg)

Based on our experience in 3D Printing, we've made some base configurations in order to make it easier to print good quality objects from day one.

You will find separated configurations for the single extruder and the dual extruder option as well as different materials. The corresponding files are organized as follows:

1. Configurations
    1. Single Extruder
        + Slic3r
            + ABS
            + PLA
            + Nylon
            + Filaflex
        + Cura
            + Filaflex
    2. Dual Extruder
        + Slic3r
            + ABS
            + PLA
        + Cura
            + ABS
            + PLA
        + Calibration
