The configurations have been designed for BCN3D + with 0.4mm nozzle.

Should serve as a starting point and can be improved to go more quickly, get a better finish ...

The abbreviations correspond to:

ST: Configuring standard height of 0.2mm layer for most buildings.

HQ: Configuring high quality standard layer height of 0.1mm for most buildings.

HS: Configuring designed for jobs that need to get the model of a quick way, without losing much quality.
      For this, a layer height of 0.25, an infill of 10% is set, perform slamente 2 perimeters and the speed is increased.

SV: Special packaging type for Configuring pieces. No infill piece and be manufactured with a spiral superifie unique, improving surface finish.

WALL: Special for pieces Configuring geomtras very "exotic", such as those generated by the algorithm Voronoi, with its maximum exponent in the designer Dizingof.
      No infill and the temperature and speed is lowered to improve the cantilevers.

STR: especially for parts that require a major effort Configuring mechanics.
      The infil is made in honeycomb and the layer height is reduced to 0.15mm to improve adhesin enetre layers.
